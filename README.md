ðŸ¤– Harmixâ„¢ Telegram ChatBot â€“ an intelligent service that automatically selects the right music for your video.

## About Harmix
Video bloggers, video editors, and music writers spend a lot of time, choosing the right music for their video. Moreover, after they spend about 4 hours listening to hundreds of tracks in music libraries, no one will guarantee you that the selected song will be really appropriate for the video. Therefore, we created [Harmixâ„¢](https://www.harmix.com.ua) â€“ an intelligent service that automatically selects the right music for your video just in seconds.

## Get started
To start, open `harmix_bot.py`
